# cssClassToglerScroll

cssClassToglerClass is a sufficient ES6 class that can be used to toggle html element's css class on scroll.
It has two parameters element and cssClass.
When more than 10% of the element is onscreen, cssClassToglerScroll adds the class that you mentioned as the second argument. 
When 10% or less of the element is onscreen, the css class gets removed. The appearance of the elements once they are > 10% onscreen is
up to your css class.
